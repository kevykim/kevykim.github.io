                <p className="about_p">
                Transitioning from education to software engineering, I've developed a passion for crafting websites and apps with a mix of logic and code. My creative eye for design and fascination with software development's endless possibilities drive my constant pursuit of challenges and skill improvement.

                <p className="about_p">
                After successfully completing a challenging 6-month software development bootcamp at App Academy, I engaged in volunteer initiatives like Chingu and Hack For LA, refining both my teamwork and technical skills.
                Additionally, my role as a Web Developer Intern at Mindhome offered hands-on exposure to full-stack development. This experience allowed me to improve web applications, enhance user experiences, and sharpen my coding abilities and industry knowledge.

                <p className="about_p">
                When I'm not coding, you can often find me hiking, snowboarding, or playing video games.
                </p>

                <p className="about_p">
                Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect. I look forward to hearing from you!
